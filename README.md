- 👋 Hi, I’m @EvaYueh
- 👀 I’m interested in communicating with stakeholders in the Filecoin community to know how my company eyeball FinTech Co., Ltd. could be of value to them.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use GitHub searching for information with respect to the status of Filecoin Network so that I could possibly better communicate with my colleagues concerned.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on Filecoin community to build up a partnership with members of various categories of the Filecoin ecosystem.
- 📫 How to reach me yyyueh@eyem5.com
